# HOOK Landing Page 🪝
Built this landing page with pure HTML and CSS—no frameworks, just grit. I’m not at my 10,000 hours yet, but I’m close! This project’s my way to nail the basics before jumping into JavaScript.

## Why?
To test my HTML/CSS skills.
To wrestle with grids, flexbox, and responsiveness (it’s a bit laggy, but I’m learning).
To show up and keep building, no perfection needed.

## The Vibe
A bold landing page for HOOK, a fake agency making killer landing pages. Think purple (#9c36b5) and clean layouts. Responsiveness? Still a work in progress, but I’ll get there.

## Thanks for Checking It Out!
Dive in, spot the quirks, and have fun. I’m just a coder learning the ropes! 😎
